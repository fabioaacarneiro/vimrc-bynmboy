this setup you can programing in various languages whith autocomplete
omnifunc, show syntax errors, snippets, all you need to programing like a boss on vim

remember, you can use this setup whith vim, neovim, gvim ( or vim-gtk )
running in windows, linux or mac, but you need other more things like:
python 3.7, git,vim-plug, etc. In windows Seven, i need powershell,
chocolatey and gvim for better experience in my works whith vim.
In linux you don't need some things, i gues this things has instaled on distro,
in my Slackware i'dont need install nothing, just only vim-plug.In Mac, 
i don't know if you are need install something to use well this setup, 
i never has use mac xD. Windows 8 or 10, just install Chocolatey in Power-Sell and
use " choco install 'program' ". I will past in here somes link case you need ther.

for slackware users this python 3.7 from my repository on google drive:

maybe in linux for nvim users, for activated python support

pip3 install --user nvim


after this step, run in nvim 

:checkhealth
